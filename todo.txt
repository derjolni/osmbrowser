- create drawingstyle class to hold style
- split drawingstyle to a different control, so multiple styling rules can reference the same style and the rule display is less cluttered
- create RuleSet class to hold all rules + styles needed for a renderjob. This makes background/ multithreaded rendering easier
- create rule to hide/show/color selection
- draw relations & nodes with tags
- draw name tags on map?
- allow saving current selection to osm
- on pan draw only new parts
- draw wide roads/ line/fill styles
- empty or/and should act as disabled
- disabled rule should not be evaluated at all
- read multiple files
- start without cmdline args and open file from menu
- read shapefiles?
- create list of tags in map (with counts)




=======multipolygons==============
the renderer should colelct all outer/inner polygon parts and turn them into one big polygon before rendering:
- for all ways in the polygon (outer/inner) look at both endpoints. Find a matching endpoint (either on the same way or on another one in the relation)
- when a match is found join both parts into a single (temporary ) way
- whe all matches have been connected and there are still endpointsm left, join these to the nearest endpoint
